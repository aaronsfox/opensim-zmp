Zero Moment Point (ZMP) Change Log
===============

The changes to the OpenSim core code associated with the Zero Moment Point approaches included as part of this repository are summarised below.

## Classes

- A series of classes were created within the `osimSimulation` library under `OpenSim\Simulation\Model`:
  - `ZmpGroundReactions` was added as `ModelComponent` class. This class serves as a base for most calculations associated with the ZMP estimates of ground reactions.
  - `ContactPointSet` was added as a `ModelComponentSet` class. This serves as a convenience class to store `ContactPoint` objects.
  - `ContactPoint` was added as a `Station` class. The class sits inside a `ContactPointSet` and serves as a series of points which can be queried for ground contact within relevant functions of the `ZMPGroundReactions` class.
  - **TODO: other classes..**

**TODO: Class names should be more generic (i.e. ContactBody) so they could be leveraged by other components/classes later on...**

- **TODO:** `ZeroMomentPointContactForce` as a `Force` class
  - A force will be connected to each contact body, subsequently reading the forces to apply to the body at the designated point
- **TODO:** `ZeroMomentPointContactPointConstraint` as a `UnilateralConstraint` class
  - Points that prevent contact penetration with the ground
- **TODO:** `MocoZeroMomentPointContactTrackingGoal`
  - `MocoGoal` that tracks the forces from the `ZeroMomentPointContactForce` object in a similar way that is done to the contact tracking goal with contact spheres
  - Can consider that this could track both forces and COP
- TODO: `ZeroMomentPointCopConstraint`
  - Some sort of `Constraint` that somehow constrains the COP to remain within the boundaries or near the contact points. If nearby it would need a distance parameter to ensure the COP isn't more than a certain distance from estimated point. 
- **NOTE:** potentially a little bloated with the number of classes needed for this...



## Examples [TODO: update with accurate descriptions...]

### Basic Demo

This example demonstrates how to create and connect the various new classes to a model, alongside a few demonstrations of key functions related to the ZMP estimates of ground reactions. 

### [TODO]: ZMP Ground Reactions from Motion

This example uses the `ZeroMomentPointGroundReactions` class with the `ZeroMomentPointContactBody` and `ZeroMomentPointContactBodyPoint` classes to estimate ground reactions (forces, centre of pressure, moments) from a specified motion. The motion comes from a Moco tracking solution, with a states trajectory and table of accelerations created to calculate the ground reactions. The data comes from treadmill running, therefore the ground contact points are checked using the distance only method as the velocity of the contact points is influenced by the foot moving on the treadmill. The output of this example is a `.mot` file similar to what you would create from experimental ground reaction forces (and subsequently create an associated `ExternalLoads` `.xml` file for).

**TODO:**

- `exampleZmpGroundReactionsFromState.cpp`: estimating GRFs and COP from a singular state â€” which would probably require more complete simulation inputs (i.e. underlying forces etc.)
- `exampleZmpContactForce.cpp`: working through a series of states apply the forces from the ZMP estimates to a model. Run inverse dynamics on this plus the original model with external loads included, and theoretically the inverse dynamics outputs should be similar.
- `exampleZmpTrackingSimulation.cpp`: running a Moco tracking problem using the component
- `exampleZmpPredictiveSimulation.cpp`: running a Moco predictive problem and exporting the GRFs and COP estimated from the component?



## Bindings

- **TODO:** figure out how to include new classes in `OpenSimHeaders_simulation.h` for relevant bindings?
- **TODO:** create new `test_zmp_component.py` to Python bindings test.

## Sandbox

- Added a `Zmp` folder to the sandbox to test out C++ executables for the project
  - Moved ContactPointConstraint to this area as not functional with new class set/library
  - Moved ZmpForce to this area as not functional with new class set/library
  - Moved supplementary files for creating `osimZmp` library to this folder after shelving idea
